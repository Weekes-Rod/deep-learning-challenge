# Deep Learning Challenge

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Background

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup aims to select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, we will create a binary classifier to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset provided contains metadata about organizations that have received funding, including features such as application type, affiliation, organization classification, use case for funding, and more.

### Instructions

**Before You Begin:**

1. **Create a New Repository**: Create a new repository for this project called `deep-learning-challenge`. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. **Create Directory**: Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Deep Learning Challenge.

4. **Push to GitHub**: Push the above changes to GitHub.

**Step 1: Preprocess the Data:**

1. Upload the starter file to Google Colab and preprocess the dataset.
2. Identify the target(s) and feature(s) for the model.
3. Drop the EIN and NAME columns.
4. Determine unique values for each column and handle rare occurrences.
5. Encode categorical variables.
6. Split data into features and target arrays.
7. Scale the features datasets.

**Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model:**

1. Design a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Create hidden layers with appropriate activation functions.
3. Compile and train the model.
4. Evaluate the model's loss and accuracy.
5. Save the model's weights to an HDF5 file.

**Step 3: Optimize the Model:**

1. Adjust input data to optimize the model's performance.
2. Experiment with adding neurons and hidden layers.
3. Try different activation functions and epochs.

**Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model:**

1. Provide an overview of the analysis and its purpose.
2. Summarize the results of data preprocessing and model training.
3. Discuss the neural network architecture and optimization attempts.
4. Include recommendations for improving model performance.

**Step 5: Copy Files Into Your Repository:**

1. Download Colab notebooks and move them into the Deep Learning Challenge directory.
2. Push the added files to GitHub for final submission.
